This is a bot to be used to look up information on monsters in the game Monster Hunter World. For reference,
The Handler is the main character's partner who helps organize their missions. She also has a huge appetite.

The bot scrapes HTML from the website:

https://monsterhunter.fandom.com/wiki

and returns relevant information. 

Here is a demo:
